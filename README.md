# VIP-Evaluations

I attached....

  1. The Results I got from my tests
  
  2. The script that has both the evaluation code and the peak picking itself
  
  3. The folder full of songs I used
  
  4. The folder full of corresponding annotations
  
  5. The environment LibFMP uses
  
From my testing, it seems to me like the interval between detected beats was fairly in line with the annotations, but the actual timing of the beats themselves were off. I don't know if this is just a discrepancy in the recordings I used compared to the ones the datasets used. I especially think this because the harmonix data set has FAR worse results than the beatles one. I guess let me know if you see something wrong or get results I didn't.
